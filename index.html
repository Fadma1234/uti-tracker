	<h2>Test instructions</h2>
	<p>Wash your hands with soap and water to ensure they are clean.
		Cleanse the area. Gently wash your genital area with soap and water and rinse thoroughly. For women, wipe from
		front to back.
		Collect your sample in one of two ways:
		Midstream catch: Begin urinating into the toilet. After 1 to 2 seconds, move a clean, dry cup into the stream to
		collect a sample.
		Dip directly: Void urine into a clean, dry container.
		Dip the test strip. Remove a single test strip from its package, avoiding touching the test pads. Dip the test
		pads into the urine for 1 to 2 seconds to make sure they are completely saturated.
		Remove excess urine. Gently tap or scrape the edge of the strip against the side of the cup or against an
		absorbent material like a paper towel to remove any extra urine.
		Lay the strip flat with the test pads facing up and start timing. </p>
